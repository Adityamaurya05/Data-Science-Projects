### Advantages of Mutual Funds

- **Diversification**: Reduces risk by spreading investments across assets.
- **Liquidity**: Easy to buy and sell units.

## Types of Mutual Funds

Mutual funds in India can be broadly classified into the following categories:

### Equity Funds

Equity funds invest primarily in stocks and are suitable for investors seeking long-term growth. These funds are generally riskier but offer higher potential returns.

#### Subtypes of Equity Funds

- **Large-Cap Funds**: Invest in large, stable companies.
- **Mid-Cap Funds**: Focus on medium-sized companies with growth potential.
- **Small-Cap Funds**: Target smaller companies with high risk and reward.
- **ELSS (Equity-Linked Savings Schemes)**: Tax-saving equity funds with a 3-year lock-in.

### Debt Funds

Debt funds invest in bonds and fixed-income instruments. They are less risky than equity funds and suit conservative investors.

#### Subtypes of Debt Funds

- **Short-Term Debt Funds**: For short investment horizons.
- **Long-Term Debt Funds**: For steady returns over longer periods.
- **Liquid Funds**: Highly liquid, low-risk options.
- **Gilt Funds**: Invest in government securities with minimal credit risk.

### Hybrid Funds

Hybrid funds invest in both equity and debt, balancing risk and return. They are ideal for moderate risk-takers.

#### Subtypes of Hybrid Funds

- **Balanced Funds**: Equal allocation to equity and debt.
- **Aggressive Hybrid Funds**: Higher equity exposure.
- **Conservative Hybrid Funds**: Higher debt exposure.

### Sector Funds

Sector funds focus on specific industries (e.g., IT, healthcare). They are highly risky and suitable for investors with sector-specific knowledge.

### Index Funds

Index funds replicate a stock market index (e.g., Nifty 50). They offer low costs and are ideal for passive investors.
