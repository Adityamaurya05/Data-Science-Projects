## Types of Mutual Funds

Mutual funds in India can be broadly classified into the following categories:

#### Subtypes of Equity Funds:
- Large-Cap Funds
- Mid-Cap Funds
- Small-Cap Funds
- ELSS (Equity-Linked Savings Schemes)

### Debt Funds
Debt funds invest in bonds and other fixed-income instruments. They are less risky than equity funds and are suitable for conservative investors.

#### Subtypes of Debt Funds:
- Short-Term Debt Funds
- Long-Term Debt Funds
- Liquid Funds
- Gilt Funds

### Hybrid Funds
Hybrid funds invest in both equity and debt, offering a balance between risk and return. They are ideal for moderate risk-takers.

#### Subtypes of Hybrid Funds:
- Balanced Funds
- Aggressive Hybrid Funds
- Conservative Hybrid Funds

### Sector Funds
Sector funds focus on specific industries, such as IT, healthcare, or real estate. These funds are highly risky and suitable for those with deep knowledge of specific sectors.

### Index Funds
Index funds replicate a particular stock market index (e.g., Nifty 50). They offer low costs and are suitable for passive investors.
